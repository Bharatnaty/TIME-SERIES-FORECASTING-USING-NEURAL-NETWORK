# TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING-USING-NEURAL-NETWORK
RCNN deal with sequence of data(Time Series Forecasting) to predict the output,now we will try to predict stock price

# STEP BY STEP<br>
1.load the data ,check the "null values"<br>
2.split the data into train,test<br>
3.Normalization should take place in data for better result<br>
4.get first 60 days data as "input" and next day data as "ouput"<br>
5.repeat the same step for test data <br>
6.create the neural network model with "RNN","SRNN","GRU"<br>
7.train and compile the model<br>
