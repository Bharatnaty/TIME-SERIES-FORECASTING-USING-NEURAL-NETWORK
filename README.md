# TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING-USING-NEURAL-NETWORK
RCNN deal with sequence of data(Time Series Forecasting) to predict the output,now we will try to predict stock price

# STEP BY STEP
1.load the data ,check the "null values"
2.split the data into train,test
3.Normalization should take place in data for better result
4.get first 60 days data as "input" and next day data as "ouput"
5.repeat the same step for test data 
6.create the neural network model with "RNN","SRNN","GRU"
7.train and compile the model
